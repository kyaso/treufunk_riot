The file "_treufunk.h" needs to be copied to drivers/include/treufunk.h. Alternatively you could also leave "_treufunk.h" in this folder, and just create a symlink called "treufunk.h" inside drivers/include.

You can change SPI Parameters in the treufunk_params.h file.

Also, you have to add the folling constants to the "netopt_state_t" struct in sys/include/net/netopt.h:

NETOPT_STATE_DEEPSLEEP
NETOPT_STATE_BUSY
NETOPT_STATE_TXRDY
NETOPT_STATE_RXRDY
