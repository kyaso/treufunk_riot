This application lets you test the basic communication with the Treufunk Chip.
It does not include any network stack related stuff. Therefore this is mainly used for debugging the chip.

The most important commands are:

* register read / write
* getting phy_status
* setting pll
* get state
* send
* read out received data

There are more commands available. Type "help" in the RIOT shell.

Reading a register value: 			rr <addr>
Writing into a register:			rw <addr>
Get phy_status byte:				phy
Send a string over the air:			tx <your message>
Send a repeating pattern:			tx -p <pattern(hex)> <num of bytes> # example: send 10 pattern: tx -p AA 100
Read out received data:				rx
Set state:							ss <to state> # State number corr. to phy_status
Get state:							gs
Set pll int:						pllint <tx/rx> <int_val(decimal)>
Get pll int:						pllint <tx/rx>
pll frac set/get					exactly same as pllint, just "frac" instead of "int"; but the frac values must be in hex.
