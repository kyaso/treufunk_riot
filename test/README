This application lets you test the driver in the native environment of RIOT. All hardware related features are disabled. You can "simulate" the Treufunk Chip by calling "changestate <tostate>", and maually setting the "FIFO_EMPTY" flag in phy_status (which is used by the polling timer to determine if a frame was received) by using changefifo <0/1>.
For example you want to simulate a received packet. Then first call "changefifo 0", and after that "changestate 2" (2 = SLEEP). If debug messages are enabled, you should see the timer firering, and the receive procedure starting. The "packet" can be modified, by changing the array "pframe" in the "treufunk_fifo_read()" function inside treufunk_internal.h.
